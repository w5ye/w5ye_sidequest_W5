## Description

Based on Week 5 Example 4 code, this project introduces 4 different meditative regions (deep sea - north, shaking smoothie - east, dreamy drift - south, and shifting sands - west), each with different characteristics of player speed/camera behaviour. Each region also has randomly generated shapes for the player to explore. No shapes are generated in the "stillness circle". The purpose is to represent how each mental state can affect the player/their entire world, and to go to from a erratic area to a more calmer area whenever needed.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

The player begins in the "stillness circle" region. The player can explore the world and each region using the AWDS keys or the arrow keys to move arrow, discovering different shapes and changes in player behaviour as the region changes. For instance, in "shaking smoothie" the player moves quicker and breathes in and out quickly. The region the player is in is listed on top of the sketch. To reset the player's position back into the "stillness circle", the player can press "r".
